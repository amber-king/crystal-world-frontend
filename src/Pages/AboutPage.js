            Fellowship I created this application to work on my Full Stack Web
            Design skills. There was much focus on the backend work and
            research alongside CSS practice and refining, both which I desire
            to have as career focuses. Also, it was much time used to
            understand the work and data flow of the frontend and backend. */}
